# CryptoProject
I used CoinGecko API. Their key has small amount of requests per minute so you can change some parameters under comments about it to check all features (MainViewModel and DetailsViewModel).
I created a two-page application with navigation.
Main page displays info about top currencies on market with ability to change market.
Details page displays info about selected currency, markets where it can be purchased (with ability to click on link ang to website). Also there is search field for searching for another currency and japanese candlestick chart.
